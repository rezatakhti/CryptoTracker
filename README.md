This application uses CoinGecko API to display cryptocurrency prices. It was created using a purely programmtic UI, and I'm overall very happy about the look and feel of the app. I wanted to go for a simple yet professional design while gaining more experience with URL Session. 

### Important Concepts Used
 - Designed application from scratch in Sketch
 - Used Charts framework to create, animate, and allow user interaction with a line chart 
 - Used URL session to make API calls and created a JSON with received data using Swift's Codable protocol
 - Used collection view flow layout for main page, and created card view for second page using a child view controller 
 - Layed out all constraints programmatically using NSLayoutAnchor
 - Used UIView.animate to create constraint animations and CADisplayLink for text animations
